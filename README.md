# Claster task
A method for calculating water volume.


Branch master contains solution of the task using ForkJoin framework with recursion. It's for experiment purpose only.
Branch simple_solution contains most common solution of this task via for loop and finding the highest left and right point of the landscape.

Both solutions have test classes. I don't do these tasks using TDD because I think tdd way has cons and this method should not always be used.
